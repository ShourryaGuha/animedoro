# Animedoro

Animedoro is a productivity app based on the principles of the Pomodoro Technique. It is a tool I built to motivate students to study and make full use of their time. 
Procrastination had been a big issue for me in high school. Laying off assignments, studying late for a test, I have been through it all. The _**regret**_ and _**guilt**_ that you feel for failing at something because of your habit of procrastination is not something I wanted to feel again.

The **Pomodoro Technique** has helped me a lot, so I decide to turn it into an app! 

* Similar to how pomodoro works, animedoro has an initial timer of 37 minutes(you can change the time to 60 minutes) 
* After the timer ends, you will hear a tune stating that the timer has ended
* That's when you watch an episode of anime, which usually lasts for 23 minutes (37 + 23 = 1 hour)
* This effort-reward cycle programs your sub-conscious to put in full effort for those 37/60 minutes and get as much work done as possible, thus maximising your efficiency
* Once you have completed **4 animedroro cycles**, you get a long break for your efforts!
* You can view the number of sets completed to keep teack on your progress
* There is a result calculator button at the bottom which calculates the total work time and anime time
