# Animedoro

Animedoro is a productivity app based on the principles of the Pomodoro Technique. It is a tool I built to motivate students to study and make full use of their time. 
Procrastination had been a big issue for me in high school. Laying off assignments, studying late for a test, I have been through it all. The _**regret**_ and _**guilt**_ that you feel for failing at something because of your habit of procrastination is not something I wanted to feel again.

The **Pomodoro Technique** has helped me a lot, so I decide to turn it into an app! 

* Similar to how pomodoro works, animedoro has an initial timer of 37 minutes(you can change the time to 60 minutes)

* After the timer ends, you will hear a tune stating that the timer has ended
* That's when you watch an episode of anime, which usually lasts for 23 minutes (37 + 23 = 1 hour)
* This effort-reward cycle programs your sub-conscious to put in full effort for those 37/60 minutes and get as much work done as possible, thus maximising your efficiency
* Once you have completed **4 animedroro cycles**, you get a long break for your efforts!

## App features:

1. Ability to change between _Serious_(60 min) and _Chill_(37 min) modes based on how much work do you want to finish. The break time remains the same
2. Animedoro cycle indicator (Indicated number of cycles finished)
3. Indicates the number of sets finished (1 set = 4 animedoro cycles)
4. You get a long break at the end of each set
5. Result calculator at the bottom to tell you number of hours studied and number of hours of break time
